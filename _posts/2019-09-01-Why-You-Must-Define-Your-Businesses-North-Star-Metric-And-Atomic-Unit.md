## Why You Must Develop A North Star Metric and an Atomic Unit

Developing a north star metric and an atomic unit are key to establishing your businesses digital architecture and ultimately driving your success.  A mentor of mine told me whenever getting into a new process or business that the most important thing to understand early on is defining the beginning and the end of your scope.  By this he meant to understand where business begins and ends as far as you are involved.  Short in simple to create the bookends that will ultimately define your success.

In this way, the North Star Metric and The Atomic Unit are the bookends of your business, your alpha and your omega, how you measure and what you deliver.

### The Atomic Unit

The Atomic Unit is what we here at Seance Analytics define to be the base measureable in your process.  The lowest unit you are attempting to granularize operations and reporting to.  In my work in Defaulted Mortgages we would consider the Transaction advancing funds as the Atomic Unit.  In my work in Organic Agriculture we would consider the planting of a certain product as our atomic unit.

To define the Atomic Unit for your process you must ask yourself what is your basic starting point.  This is not the time to think big picutre but rather where does the process really start.  Is it a financial transaction, is it time spent using your service, or perhaps its unique customers paying into a subscription service.  

Conversely you can ask yourself when we want to report on our operation how far down the chain does the reporting need to go to satisfactorily answer our businesses key questions.  You need to be able to drill into your information to this level but no more.

Dont confuse this with needing extremely granular dimensions like timestamping and user stamping, your atomic unit should be a fact; a specific target that is unique - for example, a planted set of vegetables with a unique identification.

### The North Star Metric

The north Star Metric is the opposite bookend.  The North Star Metric is the single metric that will define success.  As with the Atomic Unit try to define a measurable success metric that represents a fact that keeps your customers coming back.  Do not make your north star metric revenue of xx%.  Rather make your north star metric your key deliverable; Number of customers reporting satisfactory results.  If you do so - believe you me, Revenue and Sales will follow.

### Why is this needed?

Too many businesses are mired in a data rich environment where they dont have their bookends.  They collect a lot of data, even store it and report on it but have no real idea of how the data fits together using an atomic unit to drive a north star metric.  If you ask a confused reporting analyst in one of these environments how success is defined, that analyst will not be able to tell you.  They report what is asked for and nothing more, passively, never getting to the point of understanding how the data rolls up into success for the business.

Conversely if you define the North Star and Atomic unit of your business appropriately everything associates in your business do has focus.  When issues or conflicts between decisions exist the process is easy, which delivers the best lift for our north star metric.  Similarly when people suggest creating metrics you can always ask how does it relate to the atomic unit, is this metric driven by the core element that drives business success.
